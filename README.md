# 🚴 Divvy Bike Share Analysis  

This project was completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics** course. It focuses on analyzing user behavior for **Divvy Bikes**, a bike-sharing company, to understand the differences between **casual riders** and **members** and identify strategies to increase membership.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

- Analyzed **rider patterns** of **casual users** vs. **members**  
- Explored **ride duration, peak usage times, and trip locations**  
- Suggested **strategies** to convert casual riders into long-term members  

## 📂 Dataset  

The dataset contains trip details such as:  
- **Ride ID**  
- **User type (Casual / Member)**  
- **Start & end time**  
- **Trip duration**  
- **Starting & ending stations**  

## 🛠 Tools Used  

- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** for data cleaning & visualization  
- **SQL** for querying the dataset  
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards  

## 📊 Key Findings  

1. **Casual riders take longer trips** than members  
2. **Weekends see a spike in casual users**, while members ride consistently on weekdays  
3. **Peak usage hours differ**: Casual users ride during leisure hours, members during commute hours  
4. **Station popularity varies** based on user type  

## 🔍 Recommendations  

✅ Introduce **discounted weekend memberships** for casual riders  
✅ Offer **loyalty rewards** for frequent casual users  
✅ Improve **bike station accessibility** in high-traffic areas  
✅ Implement **targeted marketing campaigns** to convert casual users
