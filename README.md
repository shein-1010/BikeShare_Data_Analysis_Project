Hey there, 
I did this project as my last Assignment as a Google data analysis student on Coursera.

About the project:>
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

The approach
I am planning to do this project by going through the six phases of data analysis,
Such as Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.

1. ASK 
The questions that need to be answered are:
·         How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
·         Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
·         How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

2. PREPARE 
The dataset follows the ROCCC Analysis as described below:
Reliable - yes, not biased
Original - yes, can locate the original public data
Comprehensive - yes, not missing important information
Current - yes, updated monthly
Cited - yes
I will be using the public dataset located HERE. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license 

3. PROCESS
I have downloaded 12 months (year 2022) data from the company website and saved to project folder after unzipping.
Once the 12 months data is stored in my computer then I loaded the csv files to R studio where I decided to do initial cleaning.

Importing Data into RStudio from Download Folder.
